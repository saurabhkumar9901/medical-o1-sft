# Medical Tool 🏥  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a **Medical Tool** that integrates multiple Google APIs for location-based medical assistance. The tool also interacts with a fine-tuned medical model (`medical-o1-sft`).  

## Features 🚀  

- **Google Geolocation API** 🌍: Determines the user's approximate location.  
- **Google Places API** 📍: Finds nearby medical facilities.  
- **Google Distance Matrix API** 🚗: Calculates travel distance and time to medical locations.  
- **Integrated Location & Places Function** 🔗: Combines all three APIs for seamless data retrieval.  
- **Medical Model Call Function** 🏥: Communicates with `medical-o1-sft` to provide relevant medical insights.  

## Installation 📦  

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-tool.git
cd medical-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀  

Run the Jupyter Notebook:  

```bash
jupyter notebook medical-tool.ipynb
```

## API Keys 🔑  

Ensure you have valid **Google API keys** for Geolocation, Places, and Distance Matrix services. Store them securely in an environment variable or a `.env` file.
